<h2>Model Evaluation Overview</h2>
<p>
  To ensure the Tibetan OCR model delivers accurate and meaningful text
  recognition, we evaluate its performance using two key metrics:
  <strong>Character Error Rate (CER)</strong> and
  <strong>Word Error Rate (WER)</strong>.
</p>

<h3>Character Error Rate (CER)</h3>
<p>
  CER measures how accurately the model recognizes individual Tibetan
  characters. It calculates the number of character insertions, deletions, or
  substitutions required to match the models output with the correct text. A
  lower CER indicates higher accuracy at the character level, which is essential
  for Tibetan, where small character errors can significantly change meaning.
</p>

<h3>Word Error Rate (WER)</h3>
<p>
  WER evaluates the accuracy of full word recognition. It counts how many words
  were inserted, deleted, or substituted compared to the ground truth. A low WER
  means the model is doing well at understanding complete words, making the
  recognized text more readable and reliable.
</p>

<p>
  Together, CER and WER provide a comprehensive picture of the OCR model quality
  â€” from fine character details to full word understanding. These metrics help
  users and developers track progress, identify errors, and continuously improve
  the model.
